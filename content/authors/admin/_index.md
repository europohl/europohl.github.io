# Short bio for the left-hand sidebar
bio: |
  My name is Edwin Pohl, but feel free to call me Edwin. I'm a Master's student in Natural Resource Management and Ecological Engineering, powered by curiosity about the interface between nature and technology.
  
  On this site, you'll find a mix of my GIS projects, snapshots from field adventures, and environmental solutions I'm working on, mostly in Python and R, sometimes with QGIS.
  
  You can explore everything chronologically or jump straight to the sections on [GIS projects](/tag/gis/), [research](/tag/research/), or [fieldwork](/tag/fieldwork/), whatever suits your curiosity. Below, you'll find my experience, recent projects, and skills.
